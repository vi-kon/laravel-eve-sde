The Amarr Empire is so vast and ancient, however, that the oldest of its many settled planets have also come to be regarded as Amarr Home Worlds. Among these, perhaps the highest prestige is given to the \'Throne Worlds\', those systems surrounding Amarr itself and the first to be connected in a newly-built gate network since the collapse of the EVE gate. 

Nevertheless, the Amarr system remains at the centre of the Empire, with ancient Amarr Prime as the seat of an Imperial Throne, venerated by countless billions as holy ground.

Khanid was one of the royal heirs at the time and, in accordance with tradition, should have committed ritual suicide after losing the Succession Trial. He refused to do so and split his vast domains from the Amarr Empire, which retaliated but only managed to retake some of the vulnerable outer regions.

The Pagera Manton was a giant space-ship that was at the head of a massive Amarrian exploration team that had ventured into unknown lands hundreds of years ago. A malfunction in its warp-drive stranded the ship, far away from the rest of the fleet. During that time space-communication was not as sophisticated as today, and it had no way of contacting other vessels of the expedition. Years passed and the crew had finally lost all hope of survival. Food supply was running dangerously low, and it seemed that starvation was inevitable. It was then that one of the officers, an Ammatar by the name of Kalorr Makur, took matters into his own hands. He staged a successful coupe against the commanding officer of the ship and had his most loyal followers bind and gag the dissidents inside a secure chamber under his control. These unfortunate souls became the crews new food supply, unbeknownst to most of the crewmembers. For over a year this plan worked, although Kalorr did have to turn to his own followers eventually to replenish his stock of human meat. 

Over a century later the ship was discovered by Blood Raider pioneers scouring the distant solar-systems of OK-FEM. They found the remains of the crew, and more importantly a few dozen gigantic tanks encasing millions of liters of blood. Unbeknownst to them the blood had been collected by Kalorr who dried the human meat before consumption. The blood had been meant as a final foodsource after the meat supply had run out, but was never actually consumed as the machine responsible for recycling the air supply malfunctioned which caused the remaining crew to slowly suffocate. Fortunately the blood containers were kept in sub-freezing temperature, which despite over a century of decay were still up and working when the Pagera was found. And not only that, Kalorr Makur\'s body was discovered in its very own container, ainteger with his closest allies. 

News of the find quickly spread through the Blood Raider territories, and their revered High Priest at the time declared it a \'gift from God\'. The blood was stripped from the tanks and brought back to the Blood Raider headquarters for examination and ritualistic purposes. Kalorr was cloned, using genetic material retrieved from his body taken from the Pagera, and he was immediately instated as an officer of the Blood Raiders. Years later he was even made into a saint. 

And to this day the Pagera is closely guarded by Kalorr and his small army of clones, extremely loyal to the Blood Raiders. Drugs, many generations of cloning and a terrible history has rendered the former Amarrian traveller completely insane. And despite the Pagera being a popular point of pilgrimage for the members of the Blood Raider organization, few venture there outside of large, heavily armed groups. Kalorr is known to pick off stragglers for his sinister rituals, no matter to which religion or organization they beinteger to.

ORE was quick to claim \'ownership\' as the constellation borders its sovereign space, but the Serpentis and the Syndicate, as well as multiple entrepeneurs from the Gallente Federation, have all claimed their own piece of the pie. Inevitably collisions have occurred and the constellation has become a sort of \'warzone\' between various groups of greedy claimants.

Also by staging the tournament here, it can choose from a larger variety of competitors, such as criminals and members of outlaw organizations which would be immediately arrested in Federation space. 

The Legends Trial is a popular show on Federation TV, it is broadcasted to billions of screens across many regions. Huge money is at stake, and gambling on the events is extremely popular. It is therefore not surprising that various criminal networks are working hard to \'influence\' the outcome of the show and rig fights. The organizers of the Legends Trials have hired a sizable mercenary fleet to protect its assets, but even so it has become extremely vulnerable to pirate meddling, especially due to its new location outside of the protective embrace of Federation space. Certainly a freelance merc pilots dream come true.

Potential excavators from all over the Eve universe have come to I-3ODK in the search for the hidden treasure. Obviously this influx of people has caught the attention of the Angel Cartel, who already had a strong prescence in the area, and they have imposed high \'taxes\' on any harvesters caught in their territory. 

But the mainly Minmatar harvesters and pioneers are not the only outsiders the Cartel have had to deal with. The Sansha\'s Nation have also sent a fleet of worker-slaves escorted by an armada of warships to the constellation. Led by the brutal Sansha general Abufyr Joek, their task is to secure a supply route of booster regents to their headquarters. 

When the Cartel leadership found out about Sansha\'s meddling in their territory, they sent in their own armada, spearheaded by the military genius Krur Tajar, to secure total domination of I-3ODK. He has set up camp in BJD4-E, claiming the mining outpost Freeboter\'s Haven for himself, from where he has launched repeated attacks against all those who refuse to pay the Cartel their due tribute.

He apparently fled his homeland after Republic authorities threatened an invasion should he not be extradited into their hands. It is believed that he has become involved in the booster smuggling business, working aintegerside the Angel Cartel. 

Martokar\'s previous crimes include the murder of CONCORD officers, kidnapping and sale of Republic citizens into slavery. Investigators also blamed him for managing a large criminal network inside the Republic territories, which had direct links to the Angel Cartel. And although it is common knowledge that the Thukker Tribe leadership has strong ties to the Cartel, Dulinar Nerhoger, chief of intelligence in the Republic Justice Department, believes that Martokar\'s crimes are grave enough to warrant special attention. He advises all travelers venturing into 760-9C to keep an eye out for Martokar, he is considered extremely dangerous.
